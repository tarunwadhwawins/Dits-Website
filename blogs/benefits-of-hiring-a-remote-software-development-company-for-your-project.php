					<p>Remote software development has been quite a trend and favorite for a few years now. Remote software development teams that make up remote development are typically a team of designers, product engineers, QA’s, developers, and product managers. All of them work individually over the project cumulatively, till the product is delivered.</p>
					<p>Normally, in outsourcing, the concerned <b><a href="https://www.ditstek.com/services/hire-remote-developers" target="_blank">remote software development company</a></b> have dedicated managers superintending the projects. But post the outbreak of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic, things are changing. Due to work from home, remote teams work from diverse locations. For Businesses, it is a tiresome task to assure the management of these remote teams. </p>
					<p>There has always been a cold war amid the alternatives of hiring an in-house development team and <b>hiring remote developers.</b> There has always been a cold war amid the alternatives of hiring an in-house development team and hiring remote developers. Earlier managers considered it to be less effective in terms of communication for remote developers, but the time has changed!</p>
					<p>The list of businesses <b><a href="https://www.ditstek.com/services/dedicated-development-team" target="_blank">hiring remote development companies</a></b> is now growing day after day, the grounds for such a change are here!</p>
					<p>Benefits of <b>hiring a remote developer’s company.</b></p>
					<h3>1. Save Money</h3>
					<img src="../assets/images/benefits-of hiring-a-remote-software-development-company-for-your-project-1.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-2" alt="image"/>
					<p>While you hire an in-house full-time developer’s team at your own office, you need good infrastructure. Setting up IT infrastructure for your developer’s team may cost you a couple of thousands of bucks. While dealing with the remote team, you save a whopping cost of your IT infrastructure, workplace, etc.</p>
					<p>Moreover, remote employees do not demand any extraneous facilities like meals, refreshments, electricity bills, the Internet, computation, etc. Ultimately, hiring a remote developer’s team will help you save on all this stuff.</p>
					
					<h3>2. Broader Area To Cover</h3>
					
					<p>While hiring for your office, you need to restrict yourself to a limited pool of talent that belongs to your geographical area. Whereas there are hundreds of thousands of developers who are extremely talented and suit your requirements. Maybe you are established in the state of Illinois, you can get an extremely talented remote team of developers from India!</p>
					<p>You need not have to provide them with working space, infrastructure, commute facilities, etc., and yet you can get a team as per your requirements.</p>
					<h3>3. Higher Efficiency</h3>
					<img src="../assets/images/benefits-of hiring-a-remote-software-development-company-for-your-project-2.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-2" alt="image"/>
					<p>Not all developers work best in 9 to 5! <br> According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2016/05/02/are-remote-workers-happier-and-more-productive-new-survey-offers-answers/#66636dfd6663" target=""_blank> Forbes</a>, 91% of the developers feel that they are more productive working remotely, independently, and at their convenient time. Whereas there are only 9% of developers that believe that they can be more productive working in an office environment.</p>
					<p>Remote work allows the late-night owls and early risers to work at the time when they feel they are most productive. This will ultimately help you increase the productivity of the team thus that of the company’s</p>
					<h3>4. Stronger Connectivity</h3>
					<img src="../assets/images/benefits-of hiring-a-remote-software-development-company-for-your-project-3.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-2" alt="image"/>
					<p>This point may seem to be counter-intuitive at the first thought but it is not! In a <a href="http://www.globalrewardsolutions.com/engage-remote-workers-with-rewards-and-incentives/" target="_blank"> separate study</a>, it was concluded that 87 percent of remote workers feel that they are more connected to their co-workers and to the managers.<br>While connecting the mates with video conferences and maybe on company’s retreat, people feel more connected to each other.</p>
					
					
					<h3>5. Anticipations Shows, This Is The Future</h3>
					<img src="../assets/images/benefits-of hiring-a-remote-software-development-company-for-your-project-4.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-2" alt="image"/>
					<p>A few years back, working from home did not seem to be a great option from the manager’s point of view, but now the tables will turn around. </p>
					<p>The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/atus.pdf" target="_blank"> studies</a> show that 23 percent of employees reported doing some of the other work from home in 2015. Whereas, the number was 19 percent back in 2003.</p>
					<p>These numbers are expected to rise soon with the parabolic curve. These five concrete reasons show how beneficial it is to hire a remote developer’s team. A lot of businesses have already implemented this and multiple of them are to implement remote work culture in the next couple of years.</p>
					
					
					<h3>6. Gain Access To Top Talent Everywhere</h3>
					<img src="../assets/images/benefits-of hiring-a-remote-software-development-company-for-your-project-5.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-2" alt="image"/>
					
					<p>When a recruiter recruits from a pool of aspirants in an immediate geographic area, their ability to hire the best developer is limited. Expanding your software team to a global pool of applicants gives your company the best possible fit for the project. </p>
					<p>According to Hackerrank’s <a href="https://info.hackerrank.com/rs/487-WAY-049/images/HackerRank_2019-2018_Developer-Skills-Report.pdf" target="_blank"> 2019 Developer Skills Report</a>, “41% of employers say that talent shortage is an issue they face when hiring developers.” Recruiting around the world allows a company to bring in an engineer from Silicon Valley to work with a Java specialist from Poland and a software developer from the Philippines. Talent shortage: solved. </p>
					
					
					<h3>7. Eliminate The Risks Of Outsourcing</h3>
					<img src="../assets/images/benefits-of hiring-a-remote-software-development-company-for-your-project-6.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-2" alt="image"/>
					<p>Some businesses just need short-term, project-based assistance; others need a full-time remote team to help them achieve their company's objectives. In this second instance, many firms would try to take the shortest route, outsource their project incrementally to freelancers or to a third-party firm. They lose the ability to control the project, never build a dedicated team, and spend more time and money on quality control than if they had hired a discreet, vetted team of remote coders. Hire  dedicated remote software developers coordinated through one party, to sustain "full control of the workflow and remove the risk associated with outsourcing."</p>
					
					
					<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
					<p>Choosing a remote development team of high-skilled IT specialists allows reaping lots of benefits. You can get fast access to the services of the professional development teams ready to start working immediately. An experienced software development company can gather the development team possessing a set of skills required for your particular project in a short time. It frees up your time and allows you to focus on the project itself. You can reduce costs by eliminating the need for searching, interviewing, and hiring a full-time employee. You can choose a person or a development team with the specific skill set your project needs.</p>
