                     <p>Nobody knew how 2020 would end when it started. The Covid-19 crisis has forced many industries to embrace digital transformation more than ever before. The fraction of companies that have moved online in the past few months alone is more than those in the last many decades.</p>
                     <p>There’s a lot at stake for 2021, and there the question is whether mainstream technologies such as data analytics and AI will stay in force. Or will we see more distinct forms of technology overlooking the year?</p>
                     <p>Even if time is the individual judge and determinant, here are probable technology trends that will dominate 2021:</p>
					 <h3>1. 5G Will Be At Mainstream</h3>
					                      <img src="../assets/images/Blog-cover- Dits25-1.jpg" title="" alt="" class="img-fluid">

                     <p>All that talk and hype around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G">5G</a> will become live in 2021. The call for a reliable and fast connection became urgent only a few months earlier. In terms of digital collaboration, remote work and video conferencing became a part of our lives; we had to get ways to increase speed.</p>
                     <p>It was previously clear enough for telecommunication firms that 5G was the way to go. The deployment of this technology will be valuable for different tools like IoT. Approximately 51% of organizations using IoT have noted an enhanced insight into client requirements, behaviors, and choices. 5G, for sure, will skyrocket in 2021.</p>
                     <h3>2. Customer Data Platforms (CDP)</h3>
                                          <img src="../assets/images/Blog-cover-Dits26.jpg" title="" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

                     <p>In the last few moons, we have observed an increase in <a href="https://tealium.com/resource/fundamentals/what-is-a-cdp/">customer data platforms (CDP)</a>. It’s hard to reorganize fragmented data from multiple sources. To work efficiently, you’ll need well-curated and timely operations.</p>
                     <p>In recent research, a predicted $3 trillion goes down the waste yearly due to inferior data. Therefore, you must address this problem early as a business. Fortunately, CDPs help to solve this intricacy by accumulating data from all sources. They then organize it, tag it, and make it usable.</p>
                     <h3>3. Internet of Behaviors(IoB)</h3>
                                          <img src="../assets/images/Blog-cover-Dits27.jpg" title="" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

                     <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/02/11/how-agile-will-drive-the-internet-of-behaviors-iob-in-2021-and-beyond/?sh=764e7a823663">IoB</a> is a forthcoming trend that you’ll hear more of in 2021. Businesses are taking the support of technology to watch consumer and client behaviors. Some of the efficient technological tools here incorporate location tracking, big data, and facial recognition.</p>
                     <p>According to a prediction by Gartner, more than half of the global population will be under an IoB tool by 2025.</p>
                     <h3>4. Cybersecurity Mesh</h3>
                                          <img src="../assets/images/Blog-cover-Dits28.jpg" title="" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

                     <p>The <a href="https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/cloud/gartner-s-top-technology-trends-that-will-define-2021/7">cybersecurity mesh</a>, allows you to access any digital security asset – irrespective of its location. The advantage of this technology is that it enables people to put the security wall around individuals rather than the whole entity.</p>
                     <p>The unexpected increase in remote workforce and cloud technology has impacted the security of company assets beyond the company's boundaries. Thanks to the support of cybersecurity mesh, the security perimeter stretches beyond and protects people working remotely.</p>
                     <h3>5.  Intelligent Composable Business</h3>
                                          <img src="../assets/images/Blog-cover-Dits29.jpg" title="" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

                     <p>This trend intends on taking benefit of the packaged business capabilities. You can build it by contractors or you can do it in-house. ICB aids in bringing various things together, like better accessibility to evolving data, wise decision making, and delivery of applications.</p>
                     <h3>6. Hybrid Cloud</h3>
                                          <img src="../assets/images/Blog-cover-Dits30.jpg" title="" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

                     <p>Most companies are heading towards a hybrid cloud platform. The logic is simple: the hybrid cloud is more versatile. It lets companies balance their distinct cloud infrastructure requirements.</p>
                     <p>Several of the major public cloud providers have begun to emphasize on the hybrid cloud.</p>
                     <p>Some of them include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services">Amazon Web Services(AWS)</a>, Google Cloud, <a href="https://ditstek.com/technology">Azure</a>, Oracle, and IBM.</p>
                     <p>All of this aims to address the various customer challenges, including:</p>
                     <p><li>Privacy</li></p>
                     <p><li>Security and Compliance.</li></p>
                     <p><li>Exponential Data Growth.</li></p>
                     <h3>7.  Privacy and Confidential Computing</h3>
                                          <img src="../assets/images/blog-cover-Dits31.jpg" title="" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

                     <p>It entails the authentication of the whole computing process and not just the data. This adds additional layers of protection that increase the safety of confidential data. We can expect more of privacy and confidential computing in action come 2021.</p>
                     <h3>8.  Smart Work from Home Technologies</h3>
                                          <img src="../assets/images/blog-cover-Dits32.jpg" title="" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

                     <p>The covid-19 crisis has transformed the way things were done and do business. It would originally be radical to encourage people to work from home on a wide scale. Even when employees were asking for enhanced work flexibility, it was never to be.</p>
                     <p>Existing lock-downs have driven  a mass acceptance of work from home strategies. And several experts claim that this home-work strategy will surpass the virus outbreak. We've seen a lot of tech companies expand their work from home versatility to their employees. Some people like Twitter have also offered their workers the ability to work exclusively from home for the rest of their careers.</p>
                     <p>Part of what has made all this a possibility is the deployment of smart home tools such as WebEx, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams. These applications have seen huge use over the last few quarters, and this is predicted to continue even in 2021.</p>
                     <h3>9. Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                                          <img src="../assets/images/blog-cover-Dits33.jpg" title="" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

                     <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a> continued to improve operations for several businesses and firms. The outbreak has also made usage more prominent. AI, data, and machine learning played an unprecedented role throughout this Covid-19 era.</p>
                     <p>We've seen how AI allows users get feedback when they shop on Amazon, or even when they stream Netflix shows. More businesses will benefit from AI as the cloud begins to have access to growing computing power, software, and frameworks. It is predicted that 45 percent of companies using AI have raised their average spending per client and their ASPs.</p>
                     <h3>10. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&search=hyper+automation&fulltext=1&profile=default&ns0=1">Hyperautomation</a></h3>
                                          <img src="../assets/images/blog-cover-Dits34.jpg" title="" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

                     <p>Robotic process automation (RPA) was a key technology tool for businesses they are focusing on.  It has now shifted from task-based automation to process-based automation. The level of automation is expected to rise further as Hyperautomation rises in the coming year.</p>
                     <h3>11. Distributed Cloud</h3>
                                          <img src="../assets/images/blog-cover-Dits35.jpg" title="" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

                     <p>This involves the spreading of public cloud services to different physical locations. However, the evolution, governance, and operations of the services remain at the public cloud provider.</p>
                     <h3>12. Device Form Factors</h3>
                                          <img src="../assets/images/blog-cover-Dits36.jpg" title="" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

                  <p>Small, light, and efficient devices are currently in demands of customers.   As a result, manufacturers are heading to the calls by offering hybrid devices that double up as mobile devices.</p>
                  <p>For instance, the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 does this quite well. Folding and unfolding devices will come back into fashion in 2021.</p>
                  <h3>13. Quantum Computing</h3>
                                       <img src="../assets/images/blog-cover-Dits37.jpg" title="" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

                  <p>Quantum computing has supported in the control of COVID-19, along with the dissemination of the virus, the quest for vaccines, and the development of therapeutics. When more people become aware of quantum computing's capabilities, we would hope to see its application in a number of sectors by 2021 and beyond.</p>
                  <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
                  <p>Technology Trends 2021 might have just gotten started. But, you will see major changes this calendar year. Look to see how these new technologies could impact you for the better.</p>
