                     <p>Full stack development: It refers to the development of both front end and back end portions of web application. The front end refers to the visible portion of a website or an application, so basically it deals with the user and know-how of HTML, CSS and Java script. On the contrary, back end refers to the part which deals with the data base, order handling, user authentication, etc. in crux, we can say that it deals with the server and lay the essentials for the application or websites and know-how of PHP, C++, etc</p>

In an era of start-ups and new models, client want to deal with the single person whom he could rely upon, with whom he could approach with gusto and not having any black box. And definitely, do not want to waver between the front end and back end developer. Though many say that a full stack developer is a jack of all and master of none, which is also true, as a developer wouldn’t have much knowledge on both the prospects. However, he is having the skills and could pave a way out in case of any trouble with the help of several streams of a web and app development.</p>

Though Java Script is something common for a developer but Node, JS Angular, React, etc. is maturing, and hence laying new workouts for a developer. Also, for being a developer of particular portion and working for the same might be boring to some extent, hence it’s better to upgrade and learn.
