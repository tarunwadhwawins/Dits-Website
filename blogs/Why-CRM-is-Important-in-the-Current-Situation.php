						  				  <h3>How CRM will help in the development revolution of this year 2020 due to COVID-19?</h3>
						  <ul>
						      <li>CRM can help you identify prospective clients.</li>
						      <li>If we are providing quality service to the existing customer, he may help us to get a prospective customer- through word of mouth.</li>
							  <li>From the time the coronavirus has shaken the world, people&#39;s life has come to a halt. The virus has disturbed every aspect of people&#39;s daily life such as social distancing, travel bans, close of schools and universities, working from home and the list goes on. The revenue of every business has shaken. Be it a small business or big ones.</li>
							  <li>Due to the current prevailing situation the market is down, the purchasing power of the individuals has declined therefore the demo for the products is low.</li>
							  <li>There are only a few buyers in the market so to ensure that they don&#39;t get dissatisfied we need to use effective CRM.</li>
							  <li>This is the right time to show empathy towards your customers.</li>
							  <li>&quot;When the going gets tough, the tough get going&quot;</li>
							  <li>Be calm, make sound decisions, and execute your marketing strategies.</li>
							  <li>All are looking for some normalcy in these hectic times, give that to your customer.</li>
							  <li>Redistribute budgets and prioritize short term goals and long term goals.</li>
							  <li>COVID-19 has disturbed the business operations drastically. Our government has effectively managed to keep in mind the current situation taking care of both the health and safety of its people and business.</li>
							  <li>Don&#39;t panic but breathe- it&#39;s not necessary to reach out to every customer mentioned in the database but make sound decisions, be calm, and execute your marketing strategies.</li>
							  <li>COVID-19 is a serious disease and smart companies have taken and are taking all mandatory steps to ensure the utmost safety of their employees. Sales need to happen, also work needs to be done, opportunities need to be pursued, so overall whether employees working from home or office collaboration is mandatory, that&#39;s where CRM( Customer Relationship Management) comes in picture.</li>
							  <li>For years CRM software was under-utilized, but now all thanks to COVID-19 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management" target="_blank">CRM software</a> is utilized in full force to ensure sales are done, work is happening appropriately, opportunities are pursued and employees are working anywhere with great collaboration.</li>
							  <li>Because of remotely working culture, not necessarily every employee is engaged with meetings, hectic work, or group discussions, so most of the companies are using downtime to clean up the data- a perfect time to do some data cleaning. To make this topic more clear, downtime data cleaning means assign contacts and accounts to required employees and set objectives for data cleaning, updating, and revising by the time COVID-19 is over. This is the best tool to make your data updated as best as possible.</li>
							  <li>Due to COVID-19 disease, the remote working culture is increasing, so many employees sometimes result in missing out important information such as a mail, call, meeting, upcoming appointments. To mitigate this situation, every company must integrate the CRM application, and this way nobody will feel left out and miss any important information.</li>
							  <li>We still have many challenges and a lot of disturbance to come due to COVID-19. In this case, every business must leverage software like CRM to ensure that they are positioned to grow and thrive in the years to come.</li>
