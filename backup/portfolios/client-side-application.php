                     <p>To promote public safety and challenge offenders to become responsible productive citizens, organisations use The Business Process Management System (BPM), a computerized case file management system in compliance with Federal, State and local contracts to manage information on offenders throughout their sentences. The system gathers, stores, and retrieves information required for tracking offenders and making decisions concerning their cases.</p>
                     <p>The pre-release facilities  provides a cost-effective alternative to incarceration for offenders through a variety of community-based correctional/treatment programs. The organisations using BPM are dedicated to public safety and trust through professional, quality services which facilitate personal growth through positive change and individual responsibility of assigned offenders. Pre-Release Services with the help of BPM Is dedicated to providing resources and opportunities that SAFELY and SUCCESSFULLY restore offenders into society.</p>
                     <p>The application facilitates a SAAS based automated workflow solution for Pre-release facilities developed in Microsoft Stack. It offers community based programs such as misdemeanor probation, community service, electronic monitoring, and drug and alcohol testing and focuses on facilitating the users to manage information of federal offenders throughout their sentences. The system gathers, stores, and retrieves information required for tracking offenders and making decisions concerning their cases.BPM not only puts all the information facilities want at the touch of a key, but it has cut down drastically on paper files and helped us move into an electronic storage system.</p>
