					   <h2>Coding And Development Standards</h2>
					   <p>The end goal towards which every developer and team members works is to build a scalable and robust solution and we understand that the best applications are coded “properly” and that’s what we do. While coding our job is not to write the code, which makes the application functional, but to write it in a proper way, which will further help in add, maintain and debug. We perceive that following a consistent coding standard helps improve the quality of the overall software system and the key to a good coding standard is consistency.</p>
					  <p>To achieve the highest productivity levels our developers and DevOps engineers use the following tools on our everyday routine:GIT, GitHub, Bitbucket, TFS, SVN</p>
